### Project Euler 84 - Monopoly

Playing monopoly with 2 `N` sided dice. What are the `K` most likely squares to land
on.

----------------

A Monte Carlo simulation is plenty good enough to solve Project Euler; however,
problem 84 for Project Euler + on Hackerrank is incredibly finicky. I later
implemented a markov chain solution and after hours of debugging, I finally passed
all the test cases. At the time only 141 people had even attempted the problem. I
was the 102 to pass all the test cases.
